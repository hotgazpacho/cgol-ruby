#Conway's Game of Life in Ruby

Inspired by a [CodeRetreat](http://www.coderetreat.com/), hosted by [Corey Haines](http://www.coreyhaines.com/), that I attended in Orlando, FL. I've decided to distill many of the ideas we worked through during the 5 pairing sessions, and implement [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in a number of languages. This is a Ruby implementation. I intend to create a C# implementation, and use the understanding that I gain of the problem space to implement it other languages that I want to learn, such as Clojure.
